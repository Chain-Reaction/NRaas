         *
         * (JunJayMdM) All alarms will be set to yield only when the game speed is Normal or Paused
         ** It might defeat the purpose of preventing the Alarm Manager from halting but that's not verified
         * 
         * All alarms in the game are now set to be yielding
         ** This will stop any one alarm from halting the alarm manager, but may produce unexpected side-effects when running the game at high-speed for long durations
         * 
         * 
         * Added "Settings \ Family Depth Compress Level"
         * Added "Settings \ Minimum Route Failures Before Reset"
         * Added "Settings \ Minimum Route Failure Testing Time"
         *
