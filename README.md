Gonna open then immediately close this PR. Just reaching out to let you know that my DBPF wiki cites this repository.
- wiki: https://anonhostpi.github.io/DBPF.js/docs/other/spec/

I'm avidly working on my own DBPF reader. If you see anything missing from either the wiki or my lib, feel free let me know (or contribute)!

I know this is a bit of an odd way to reach you, but I wanted to be sure you knew I was citing your work! Impressive tool by the way!
